Subject: Progressive FG Creation Model - Master Control Integration Discussion

Anthony,

I'm reaching out to align on a phased material creation workflow that addresses SAP readiness, operational efficiency, and change control requirements. Following discussions with Jonathan and the Canada team, I've mapped out an approach that enables early visibility while maintaining quality gates.

BACKGROUND & BUSINESS CASE:

Current State Challenge:
- Materials created in a rush after E2D approval (28-day lead time known)
- All data required upfront creates bottlenecks and delays
- No system visibility until final approval stage
- Incomplete data forces rework cycles
- Late costing analysis limits decision-making

Proposed State:
- Phased material creation starting post-E2D approval
- Progressive data enrichment through child tickets
- Early SAP visibility enables planning and cost modeling
- Structured gates prevent incomplete materials from going live

Canada operates differently (all-at-once after E2D). Our US reality requires a progressive approach to balance innovation velocity with data quality.

DETAILED WORKFLOW:

PHASE 0: E2D APPROVAL COMPLETE
Trigger: Project approved in innovation process
Action: Open Master Ticket in Master Control

PHASE 1: MASTER TICKET - FERT CREATION (MINIMAL FIELDS)
Owner: Master Data (Juan)
Timing: Day 1 post-E2D approval
Action: Create material number in SAP with foundational data only

Required Fields:
- Material Description (standard naming convention validation)
- Material Type (FERT, HALB, ROH)
- Base Unit of Measure (EA, MG, KG, CV - case)
- UPC/GTIN (if available from Marketing)
- Basic Product Identifiers (flavor, size, format)
- Material Status: ND (Not Delivered) - blocks all transactions

Deliverable: Material exists in SAP but cannot be transacted
Benefit: Material number established, costing prep can begin

PHASE 2: CHILD TICKET 1 - GENERIC BOM SETUP
Owner: Master Data + PD input
Timing: Parallel to formulation development
Action: Create placeholder BOM using golden parts

Generic Components Concept:
- Ash Bulk [generic powder base]
- Bottle Generic 16oz [standard bottle placeholder]
- Cap Standard [generic closure]
- Label Placeholder [dimensioned blank]
- Case CV [standard shipping case]

Example Generic BOM:
| Component | Qty | UoM | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| ASH-BULK-GEN | 15 | MG | Powder base placeholder |
| BTL-16OZ-GEN | 1 | EA | Bottle placeholder |
| CAP-STD-GEN | 1 | EA | Cap placeholder |
| LBL-4X6-GEN | 1 | EA | Label placeholder |
| CASE-STD-CV | 1 | CV | Shipping case |

Purpose:
- Enables preliminary costing models
- Finance can run margin analysis
- BOM structure established for Planning review
- No procurement risk (generic parts not orderable)

Question for You: Can we define a golden parts library that covers 80% of our standard formats? Who should validate this library (PD, QA, Planning)?

PHASE 3: CHILD TICKET 2 - ROUTING & WORK CENTER
Owner: TBD (historically unclear ownership)
Timing: When production line is determined
Action: Create dummy routing tied to equipment

Routing Components:
- Production Line (Line 3, Line 5, etc.)
- Work Center (mixing, filling, packaging)
- Setup Time (generic estimate)
- Run Rate (generic capacity estimate)
- Labor Category (crew size standard)

Purpose:
- Enables cost allocation simulation
- Production can validate equipment feasibility
- Planning can assess capacity impact

Question for You: 
1. Who currently manages routing data creation (QA, Planning, Industrial Engineering)?
2. Do you see routing as part of Master Control scope or separate workflow?
3. Can we tie routing creation to equipment qualification in Master Control?

PHASE 4: CHILD TICKET 3 - PLANT EXTENSION & MRP VIEWS
Owner: Master Data + Planning input
Timing: When production location confirmed
Action: Extend material to plant(s) and configure MRP

MRP Configuration:
- MRP Type (PD for production)
- Lot Size (standard run quantity)
- Reorder Point (if applicable)
- Lead Time (manufacturing + QA hold)
- Safety Stock (if required)
- Procurement Type (In-house production)

Critical Decision: 
If product will be produced at multiple sites (Irvine + Windsor), extend from day 1. Retroactive extension requires rework and delays.

Purpose:
- Material visible to Planning systems
- MRP can calculate requirements
- Demand visibility established

PHASE 5: PILOT RUN DECISION GATE
Decision Point: R&D Pilot (non-GMP) vs GMP Pilot

Path A - R&D Pilot (Small Scale):
- Use generic BOM as-is
- Run test batch
- Collect learnings
- BOM remains generic

Path B - GMP Pilot (Large Scale):
- Update BOM with real components (Child Ticket 4)
- Replace generic parts with actual materials
- Update quantities to real formulation
- Validate routing parameters

BOM Update Mechanism:
If no transactions on generic components, we can:
- Substitute BOM lines (replace generic with real component)
- Update quantities to actual formulation
- Maintain same material number (no new FERT creation)

Question for You: How do we control BOM change approval through Master Control? Is there a BOM revision workflow that tracks generic → real transition?

PHASE 6: CHILD TICKET 4 - FINAL BOM & ROUTING UPDATE
Owner: PD (formulation) + Master Data (execution)
Timing: Post-pilot run, pre-production
Action: Replace placeholder BOM with production BOM

Validation Gates:
- PD confirms final formulation
- QA approves component specifications
- Procurement confirms component availability
- Planning validates quantities and yields

Purpose:
- Production-ready BOM established
- Real costing replaces estimates
- Procurement can place orders

PHASE 7: QA REVIEW & APPROVAL
Owner: QA (Anthony's team)
Timing: Post-GMP pilot completion
Action: Validate production readiness

QA Approval Checklist:
- BOM matches approved formulation
- Routing matches production process
- Labels approved and loaded
- Specifications entered in system
- Test results meet acceptance criteria
- Stability data acceptable (if required)

This is IDENTICAL to current QA gate - no process change.

Purpose: Quality gate maintained, ensures production readiness

PHASE 8: SALES & DISTRIBUTION SETUP
Owner: Sales Ops (Rosa) + Master Data
Timing: When sales channel determined
Action: Extend material to distribution channels

Sales Configuration per Channel:
- Customer-specific setup (Costco, Amazon, DTC, etc.)
- Pricing conditions
- MOQ (minimum order quantity)
- Lead times
- Shipping requirements

Important: Costing must be completed PER CHANNEL before extension. Each channel may have different cost structures (co-packing, distributor margins, etc.)

Question: Do we create separate Child Ticket per channel or batch them?

PHASE 9: FINAL COSTING VALIDATION & ACTIVATION
Owner: Finance + Master Data
Timing: All prior phases complete
Action: Lock costing and remove material blocks

Final Validation:
- BOM quantities match QA-approved formulation
- Routing matches production process
- All costs allocated correctly
- Material Status change: ND → PD (Production Deliverable)
- Remove commercial blocks
- MRP activation

Deliverable: Material live and orderable

BENEFITS QUANTIFICATION:

Time Savings:
- Current: All data required at once = 2-4 week delay waiting for complete info
- Proposed: Phased approach = material in system 4-6 weeks earlier
- Costing analysis moves from post-pilot to pre-pilot = 1-2 week decision advantage

Efficiency Gains:
- Master Data workload spread across project timeline (no bottleneck)
- Finance can model costs earlier in development cycle
- Planning visibility improves demand forecast accuracy
- Sales can quote earlier with preliminary costs

Risk Reduction:
- Prevents creating materials that fail E2D approval
- Catches BOM/routing issues before production
- Reduces "emergency material creation" scenarios
- Improves data quality through progressive validation

Resource Allocation:
- Current: 1-2 hours per material (all at once, high pressure)
- Proposed: 2-3 hours per material (phased, lower pressure, better quality)
- Net benefit: Better data quality, fewer rework cycles

Go-to-Market Impact:
- Earlier costing visibility = better pricing decisions
- Earlier system presence = better supply chain coordination
- Earlier planning visibility = better capacity management

Question for You: Once we pilot this with 3-5 products, can we quantify actual time savings for leadership presentation?

MASTER CONTROL INTEGRATION QUESTIONS:

1. **Ticket Hierarchy Feasibility:**
   - Can Master Control handle 1 Master Ticket + 6-8 Child Tickets?
   - How do we maintain ticket relationships across departments?
   - Can we flag Master Ticket "Ready" without closing it?

2. **Change Control Workflow:**
   - How do we manage BOM revisions (generic → real)?
   - What approval workflow for component substitutions?
   - Can we track BOM version history?

3. **Cross-Functional Routing:**
   - Child tickets route to: PD, QA, Planning, Sales, Finance
   - Each department adds data, passes to next
   - How do we configure routing logic?

4. **Data Input Mechanisms:**
   - Can we create fillable forms per ticket type?
   - Can we pull data from other systems (e.g., formulation from E2D project)?
   - How do we validate required fields before ticket closure?

5. **Reporting & Visibility:**
   - Can we create dashboard showing material progress through phases?
   - Can leadership see: materials in phase, bottlenecks, cycle times?
   - Can we track KPIs: time per phase, rework rate, completion rate?

6. **Integration with Other Tools:**
   - Does Master Control integrate with SAP for status updates?
   - Can we link to Wrike projects for context?
   - Can we attach E2D approval documentation automatically?

COMPARISON TO CURRENT STATE:

| Current Process | Progressive Model |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Create material after ALL data available | Create material with minimal data, enrich progressively |
| 2-4 week wait for complete info | Material exists in days, data added over weeks |
| Bottleneck at end of project | Work distributed across project timeline |
| No early costing analysis | Costing models run before pilot |
| No planning visibility | MRP sees incoming products earlier |
| Rush creates errors | Phased approach improves quality |
| Same effort, compressed timeline | Same effort, spread over timeline |

Key Insight: We're NOT adding work - we're redistributing WHEN work happens to align with natural project flow.

COMPARISON TO CANADA:

Canada Approach:
- Wait until E2D fully approved
- Create material with complete data set
- All-at-once material setup
- Works for their volume and timing

US Reality:
- Higher innovation velocity (similar volume but faster pace)
- Incomplete data at E2D approval (design evolution)
- Need for early costing visibility (margin pressure)
- Brittany's feedback: current process causes delays

Both valid - different operational contexts require different solutions.

OPEN RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Generic BOM creates confusion
- Mitigation: Clear naming (ASH-BULK-GEN vs real component)
- Clear material status: ND = not orderable
- Training: everyone understands placeholder concept

Risk 2: Change control becomes complex
- Mitigation: Master Control workflow manages transitions
- Approval gates at each phase
- Clear documentation of changes

Risk 3: John (VP) not bought in yet
- Mitigation: Pilot with 3-5 products, demonstrate value
- Quantify time savings
- Show early costing benefit with Finance support

Risk 4: Departments not ready for phased input
- Mitigation: Training and change management
- Clear RACI per phase
- Department champions identified

Risk 5: Master Control may not support workflow
- Mitigation: Wrike as backup option (Canada adopting January)
- Evaluate both platforms
- Decision needed by [DATE]
